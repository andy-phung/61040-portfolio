# Assignment 1

## Domains
- **Event planning** // envisioning, scheduling, and publicizing gatherings
- **Self care, mindfulness, and wellbeing** // building healthy habits and routines for yourself
- **Productivity and organization** // structuring your life to prioritize what matters most to you
- **Lifelong learning** // balancing busy lives with developing personal interests
- **Social activism** // promoting awareness of critical social issues and opening avenues for personal contribution
- **Job applications** // helping job candidates and employers focus on the information that really matters to each other
- **Content creation** // making the process of documenting and sharing bits of your life more accessible and enjoyable
- **Creative process** // facilitating creative decision-making and conceptual thinking for artists and designers
    - Interest → I have lots of personal experience with using tools and platforms designed for artists (Are.na, Coolors, Pinterest, etc), so I'm interested in looking into what makes these platforms work for us. I'm also super interested in how varied the processes of artists and designers across different fields and industries can be, and want to see more of the potential digital design has for supporting creatives in their work!
    - ---
    - Need → Growing artists often have trouble picking colors that work together and that produce desired responses—simple color wheels provide too much freedom, and too many options.
    - Need → Inexperienced graphic designers can get lost in picking font combinations for the same reasons as the above need.
    - Need → Artists and designers think better together—making crucial, insightful, and surprising connections rarely happens in isolation.
- **Sustainability** // increasing reuse in what we use, consume, and experience
    - Interest → I'm not that interested in the overall problem domain—just in the specific observations I made because of prior experience. I'm personally invested in improving thrifting experiences because I know how hard it can be to find good and affordable pieces at times, and in set design because I might take a class in it this semester!
    - ---
    - Need → Donated clothes usually don’t make it to the people that need or want them the most.
    - Need → Set designers often forget set pieces in storage or discard them unknowingly, increasing waste when starting new projects.
    - Need → Households unknowingly waste lots of food on a yearly basis (ingredients, cooked meals, etc)
- **Experiential design** // making personal experiences more engaging, enjoyable, and memorable
    - Interest → This is one of my areas of focus as a design major! I'm interested in the ways human-centered digital design can shape the way we experience, interact with, and participate in the world around us. This includes designing for education, imagination, dialogue, etc.   
    - ---
    - Need → Casual museum visitors don’t remember or learn much from their visits in the long run—in part because they find static, jargon-filled exhibits boring and unengaging.
    - Need → Solo travelling and tourism can be overwhelming at times.
    - Need → Concert attendees spend too much time capturing content to share later instead of having fun in the moment.



## User needs
- **Making museum experiences more memorable and engaging:** Most casual museum visitors retain little in the long run after their visits, in part because many visitors find static, jargon-filled exhibits boring, unengaging, and unaligned with their interests and underlying motivations for visiting. 
    - Stakeholders → the visitors themselves (directly impacted by their experience, want to improve outcomes for them), curators and exhibition designers (they have their own visions for what they want visitors to learn or take away from visits), museum staff (they interact with and guide visitors directly, shaping a significant part of their experience), actual museum stakeholders (who fund the museum's activities and operation, and who might care more about concrete metrics and outcomes)
    - Features (none actually listed for this need because this part would be rushed otherwise, and I think it'd be best if i took a little more time to do more user research, actually prototyped features, got feedback, etc!): 
        - (helping visitors learn more about the exhibits and materials they view, in the moment)
        - (fostering social exchange and discussion)
            - Should museums and experiencing / learning about art and history always be a solitary experience? What if we fostered discussion, social exchange, connection? How do we make this easier, more accessible, and less intimidating? How do we make art more approachable?
        - (aligning visitor activities with their individual desired outcomes)
    - Evidence: 
        - s
- **Simplifying the process of finding quality secondhand clothing:** Those who look for secondhand clothing often face lots of barriers to finding good pieces, including resellers who constantly buy them and mark them up on other platforms and a lack of curation and quality control in ordinary thrift stores like Goodwill. I’ve had lots of experience with this—especially with finding pieces that fit my style, which is most likely due to a mismatch between myself and the people that donate clothes to stores and list on some platforms like Poshmark.
    - Stakeholders → buyers/sellers (direct users), thrift stores (even less traffic), textile recycling programs (fewer clothes to process), manufacturers / brands (helps direct focus to quality pieces that are passed down, attention away from fast fashion), friends (would wonder where you got your new fits from!) 
    - Features
        - Proximity based (only people within user set distance with compatible listings)
        - filter by similarity to you (gender/body type, size, style)
            - people like you will naturally have pieces that you’re more likely to want
        - (however try-ons/selling works; could be in-person meetups to increase trust and reliability, but there are issues and barriers associated with that)
        - easy crossposting from other online thrifting platforms
            - for ease of adoption
    - Evidence
        - Depop --- like people selling to like people model example
        - Thredup --- search by type of clothing, color, etc
        - Poshmark

- **Reducing household food waste:** A significant percentage of food in households—whether it be ingredients, leftovers, or otherwise ready-to-eat food—goes to waste, and the majority of it ends up in landfills because composting programs and systems aren’t widely used yet. Moreover, food insecurity is widespread in many parts of the world—and tackling food waste could help combat this as well.
    - Stakeholders -> those who post/claim food (direct users), those living with users who claim (might use claimed ingredients), city composting programs (less to process), whoever runs landfills (less food waste there)
    - Features -> post food/ingredients that you’re not going to be able to eat in time, exchanges, coordinating dropoff / handoff / pick up, search for ingredients you need

*sources that aren’t articles or papers are okay when the problem is largely centered around distributed experience and perspectives; the best insights oftentimes come directly from users themselves!

so sorry the evidence and features + a few other things aren't fully described, i underestimated the amount of time it would take to go from the draft i had for this + ideas to this document :/
